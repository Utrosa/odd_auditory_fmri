# odd_auditory_fmri
We're developping an auditory oddball paradigm optimized for neuroimaging experiments. The deviance will be expressed with timing, frequency or both features. The python code will be designed for public use in cognitive neuroscience research, ensuring high-degree of precision, customization, and ease of use.
