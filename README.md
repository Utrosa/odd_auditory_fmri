# Sequence Selection
We developed 13 functional MRI sequences that we are comparing in their ability to record brain signals from subcortical auditory areas.

## Project Goals
1. Select functional EPI sequence with parameters optimzed for data collection from subcortical brain regions.
2. Implement and evaluate use of denosing methods: NORDIC & TAPAS
