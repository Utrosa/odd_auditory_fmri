# odd_auditory_fmri
We're developping an auditory oddball paradigm optimized for neuroimaging experiments. The oddballs will be expressed as timing and/or frequency deviants. The python code will be designed for public use in cognitive neuroscience research, ensuring high-degree of precision, customization, and ease of use.

# Project Goals
Develop an open-source python-based module for implementing an auditory oddball paradigm for cognitive neuroscience research.
